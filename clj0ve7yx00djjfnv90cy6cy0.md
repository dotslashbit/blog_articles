# Basic Concepts and Terminology

## Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices

Scalars, vectors, and matrices are fundamental concepts in linear algebra and play a central role in machine learning. Let's explore each of these concepts:

### Scalars

* Scalars have no direction and represent only magnitude. Geometrically, scalars can be thought of as points along a one-dimensional number line.
    
* They represent quantities like distance, time, temperature, or any other scalar measurement.
    
* For example, if we have a scalar value of \\(5\\), it would correspond to a point located at a distance of \\(5\\) units on the number line.
    

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

scalar = 5

plt.plot(scalar, 0, 'ro')
plt.xlim(-10, 10)
plt.ylim(-1, 1)
plt.axhline(0, color='black',linewidth=0.5)
plt.xlabel('Magnitude')
plt.title('Geometric Perspective of a Scalar')
plt.show()
```

![scalar geometric perspective](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686845849796/ee52bef7-ef9f-44f0-9876-af1f363ed01f.png align="center")

### Vectors

* Vectors have both magnitude and direction, and they can be visualized as directed line segments.
    
* Geometrically, a vector represents a displacement or movement from one point to another in space. The magnitude of a vector represents its length, while the direction indicates the orientation in space.
    
* Vectors can be positioned anywhere in space but are commonly represented as originating from the origin \\((0, 0, 0)\\).
    
* For example, a vector \\(\vec{v} = [2, 3]\\) can be represented as an arrow starting at the origin and pointing to the point \\((2, 3)\\) in a two-dimensional coordinate system.
    

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

vector = np.array([2, 3])

plt.quiver(0, 0, vector[0], vector[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1)
plt.xlim(-10, 10)
plt.ylim(-10, 10)
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
plt.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
plt.xlabel('X')
plt.ylabel('Y')
plt.title('Geometric Perspective of a Vector')
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

![geometric perspective of vector ](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686846107020/7b6fe25c-05dd-401d-902f-e0b382ac4d35.png align="center")

* Vectors can also be represented in higher-dimensional spaces. For instance, in three-dimensional space, vectors have three components \\((x, y, z)\\) and can be visualized as arrows extending in space.
    

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Define the vector
vector = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Create a figure and 3D axes
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the vector
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, vector[0], vector[1], vector[2], colors='r')

# Set limits for the axes
ax.set_xlim([0, 4])
ax.set_ylim([0, 4])
ax.set_zlim([0, 4])

# Set labels for the axes
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')

# Set the title of the plot
ax.set_title('3D Visualization of a Vector')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Vector Addition

Vector addition geometrically corresponds to placing the tail of one vector at the head of another vector. The resulting vector connects the initial point of the first vector to the final point of the second vector.

#### 2D Vector Addition

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the vectors
vector1 = np.array([2, 3])
vector2 = np.array([-1, 2])

# Perform vector addition
resultant_vector = vector1 + vector2

# Create a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the vectors
ax.quiver(0, 0, vector1[0], vector1[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='Vector 1')
ax.quiver(0, 0, vector2[0], vector2[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='Vector 2')
ax.quiver(0, 0, resultant_vector[0], resultant_vector[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='g', label='Resultant Vector')

# Add a dotted line
ax.plot([vector1[0], resultant_vector[0]], [vector1[1], resultant_vector[1]], 'k--')

# Set limits for the plot
ax.set_xlim([-3, 4])
ax.set_ylim([-1, 5])

# Set labels for the axes
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')

# Add a legend
ax.legend()

# Set the title of the plot
ax.set_title('Vector Addition Visualization in 2D')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

#### 3D Vector Addition

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Define the vectors
vector1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])
vector2 = np.array([2, -1, 1])

# Perform vector addition
resultant_vector = vector1 + vector2

# Create a figure and 3D axes
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the vectors
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, vector1[0], vector1[1], vector1[2], colors='r', label='Vector 1')
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, vector2[0], vector2[1], vector2[2], colors='b', label='Vector 2')
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, resultant_vector[0], resultant_vector[1], resultant_vector[2], colors='g', label='Resultant Vector')

ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')

# Add a legend
ax.legend()

### Vector Scalar Multiplication

Scalar multiplication of a vector changes its magnitude while maintaining its direction. Multiplying a vector by a positive scalar scales the vector, making it longer, while multiplying by a negative scalar results in a vector pointing in the opposite direction.

#### 2D Vector-Scalar Multiplication

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the vector
vector = np.array([2, 3])

# Define the scalar
scalar = 2

# Perform vector scalar multiplication
resultant_vector = scalar * vector

# Create a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the original vector
ax.quiver(0, 0, vector[0], vector[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='Original Vector')

# Plot the resultant vector
ax.quiver(0, 0, resultant_vector[0], resultant_vector[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='Resultant Vector')

# Set limits for the plot
ax.set_xlim([-5, 5])
ax.set_ylim([-5, 5])

# Set labels for the axes
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')

# Add a legend
ax.legend()

# Set the title of the plot
ax.set_title('Vector Scalar Multiplication Visualization in 2D')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

### Dot Product and Cross Product

The dot product and cross product are two fundamental operations in vector algebra that are used to compute different quantities and have distinct geometric interpretations.

#### Dot Product

The dot product, also known as the scalar product or inner product, is an operation performed between two vectors. Given two vector \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the dot product is denoted as \\(a ¬∑ b\\) and is computed as the sum of the products of their corresponding components. In mathematical notation, it is expressed as:

$$a ¬∑ b = a‚ÇÅb‚ÇÅ + a‚ÇÇb‚ÇÇ + a‚ÇÉb‚ÇÉ + ... + a‚Çôb‚Çô$$

Geometrically, the dot product represents the projection of one vector onto another vector, multiplied by the magnitude (length) of the other vector. It measures the degree of alignment or similarity between the two vectors. The dot product can be used to compute the angle between two vectors, determine if vectors are orthogonal (perpendicular), or calculate the length (magnitude) of a vector.

The result of the dot product is a single number that represents the similarity or alignment of the two vectors. If the dot product is positive, it means the vectors are pointing in a similar direction. If it's negative, it means they are pointing in opposite directions. And if it's zero, it means the vectors are perpendicular (90 degrees) to each other.

Here's the code to visualize all three types of dot products (zero, positive, and negative) using subplots:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the vectors
A = np.array([1, 2])
B_zero = np.array([-2, 1])
B_positive = np.array([2, 1])
B_negative = np.array([-2, -1])

# Compute the dot products
dot_product_zero = np.dot(A, B_zero)
dot_product_positive = np.dot(A, B_positive)
dot_product_negative = np.dot(A, B_negative)

# Create the subplots
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(15, 5))

# Plot the zero dot product
axs[0].quiver(0, 0, A[0], A[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='A')
axs[0].quiver(0, 0, B_zero[0], B_zero[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='B')
axs[0].annotate(f'Dot Product: {dot_product_zero}', xy=(-1, -0.5), xytext=(-2.5, -1), fontsize=10, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', linewidth=1.5))
axs[0].set_xlim(-5, 5)
axs[0].set_ylim(-5, 5)
axs[0].set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
axs[0].set_xlabel('X')
axs[0].set_ylabel('Y')
axs[0].set_title('Zero Dot Product')

# Plot the positive dot product
axs[1].quiver(0, 0, A[0], A[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='A')
axs[1].quiver(0, 0, B_positive[0], B_positive[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='B')
axs[1].annotate(f'Dot Product: {dot_product_positive}', xy=(0.5, -0.5), xytext=(1.5, -1), fontsize=10, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', linewidth=1.5))
axs[1].set_xlim(-5, 5)
axs[1].set_ylim(-5, 5)
axs[1].set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
axs[1].set_xlabel('X')
axs[1].set_ylabel('Y')
axs[1].set_title('Positive Dot Product')

# Plot the negative dot product
axs[2].quiver(0, 0, A[0], A[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='A')
axs[2].quiver(0, 0, B_negative[0], B_negative[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='B')
axs[2].annotate(f'Dot Product: {dot_product_negative}', xy=(-1.5, -2), xytext=(-2.5, -3), fontsize=10, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle='->', linewidth=1.5))
axs[2].set_xlim(-5, 5)
axs[2].set_ylim(-5, 5)
axs

[2].set_aspect('equal', adjustable='box')
axs[2].set_xlabel('X')
axs[2].set_ylabel('Y')
axs[2].set_title('Negative Dot Product')

# Adjust the spacing between subplots
plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0.4)

# Show the plot
plt.grid()
plt.show()
```

![dot product visualization of zero,positive and negative dot products](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687020429599/e5ae9557-c8ad-4c5c-b58b-ff785f1c3792.png align="center")

This code will create three subplots, each representing a different type of dot product: zero dot product, positive dot product, and negative dot product. The vectors `A` and `B` are plotted in each subplot, and the dot product is annotated accordingly. The subplots are displayed together, and there is spacing between them for clarity.

#### **Cross Product**

The cross product, also known as the vector product or outer product, is an operation performed between two vectors in three-dimensional space. Given two vectors \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the cross product is denoted as \\(a \times b\\) and is computed as a new vector that is orthogonal (perpendicular) to both \\(a\\) and \\(b\\). In mathematical notation, it is expressed as:

$$a √ó b = (a‚ÇÇb‚ÇÉ - a‚ÇÉb‚ÇÇ)i + (a‚ÇÉb‚ÇÅ - a‚ÇÅb‚ÇÉ)j + (a‚ÇÅb‚ÇÇ - a‚ÇÇb‚ÇÅ)k$$

where i, j, and k represent the unit vectors in the x, y, and z directions, respectively.

Geometrically, the cross product represents a vector that is perpendicular to the plane formed by the two input vectors. The direction of the resulting vector follows the right-hand rule: if you curl the fingers of your right hand from the first vector towards the second vector, the resulting vector points in the direction of your thumb. The magnitude of the cross product is equal to the area of the parallelogram formed by the two input vectors.

Here's a Python code snippet using Matplotlib to visualize the cross product:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from mpl_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

# Define the two vectors
A = np.array([1, 2, 3])
B = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Compute the cross product
cross_product = np.cross(A, B)

# Create a 3D plot
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the vectors
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, A[0], A[1], A[2], color='r', label='A')
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, B[0], B[1], B[2], color='b', label='B')
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, cross_product[0], cross_product[1], cross_product[2], color='g', label='Cross Product')

# Set the plot limits
ax.set_xlim([0, max(A[0], B[0], cross_product[0])])
ax.set_ylim([0, max(A[1], B[1], cross_product[1])])
ax.set_zlim([0, max(A[2], B[2], cross_product[2])])

# Set the labels and title
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')
ax.set_title('Cross Product Visualization')

# Add a legend
ax.legend()

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

![cross product visualization](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1687019821637/0308d2ac-0925-4b27-84cd-95f1a4c12121.png align="center")

This code will create a 3D plot that visualizes the two input vectors, A and B, along with their cross product. The vectors will be represented as arrows in the plot, with different colors for clarity. The plot will also include labels for the axes, a title, and a legend indicating which vector is represented by each color.

You can modify the values of vectors A and B to visualize different cross products. Simply update the array values in the code snippet to suit your desired vectors.

The dot product and cross product have different properties and applications in various mathematical and physical contexts. The dot product yields a scalar quantity, while the cross product yields a vector quantity. Both operations are important tools in vector algebra, geometry, physics, and applications such as mechanics, electromagnetism, and computer graphics.

Here's the Python code to compute the dot product and cross product of two vectors:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the vectors
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])

# Compute the dot product
dot_product = np.dot(a, b)

# Compute the cross product
cross_product = np.cross(a, b)

print("Dot Product:", dot_product)
print("Cross Product:", cross_product)
```

In this code, we use the NumPy library to perform the calculations. The [`np.dot`](http://np.dot)`()` function computes the dot product of the vectors `a` and `b`, while the `np.cross()` function computes the cross product of the vectors `a` and `b`. The dot product will yield a scalar value, while the cross product will yield a vector orthogonal to both `a` and `b`.

When you run this code, it will output the computed dot product and cross product of the given vectors `a` and `b`.

```python
Dot Product: 32
Cross Product: [-3  6 -3]
```

### Matrices

Matrices can be seen as collections of vectors or as transformations that operate on vectors. Geometrically, a matrix represents a linear transformation that can stretch, rotate, shear, or reflect vectors in space.

A matrix can transform a vector by stretching or scaling its magnitude, changing its direction, or both. Each column of a matrix can be interpreted as the image of a basis vector under the transformation.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the rotation angle in radians
angle = np.pi/4

# Define the rotation matrix
rotation_matrix = np.array([[np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)],
                            [np.sin(angle), np.cos(angle)]])

# Define the vector to be rotated
vector = np.array([1, 0])

# Apply the rotation matrix to the vector
rotated_vector = np.dot(rotation_matrix, vector)

# Create a figure and axes
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the original vector
ax.quiver(0, 0, vector[0], vector[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='r', label='Original Vector')

# Plot the rotated vector
ax.quiver(0, 0, rotated_vector[0], rotated_vector[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='b', label='Rotated Vector')

# Set limits for the plot
ax.set_xlim([-1.5, 1.5])
ax.set_ylim([-1.5, 1.5])

# Set labels for the axes
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')

# Add a legend
ax.legend()

# Set the title of the plot
ax.set_title('Matrix Rotation of a Vector')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

![vector rotation](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686854140737/d02eed3e-38b1-49ea-bae2-6f6ddbcb76c0.png align="center")

Matrix multiplication can be understood as the composition of linear transformations. Applying a series of matrix transformations successively is equivalent to applying a single matrix that represents the combined effect of the individual transformations.

Geometric interpretations help provide an intuitive understanding of scalars, vectors, and matrices in terms of their magnitudes, directions, transformations, and their relationships in space. These geometric perspectives are valuable for visualizing and understanding the operations and properties of these mathematical entities in the context of machine learning.

### Types of Matrices

There are several types of matrices commonly encountered in linear algebra. Here are some important types of matrices:

1. **Square Matrix**: A square matrix has an equal number of rows and columns. In other words, it is an *n x n* matrix. Square matrices are particularly important because they can be used to represent linear transformations. Examples of square matrices include 2x2, 3x3, and nxn matrices.
    
2. **Identity Matrix**: The identity matrix, denoted as *I*, is a square matrix with ones on the main diagonal and zeros elsewhere. For example, a 3x3 identity matrix looks like:
    
    ```python
    I = | 1  0  0 |
        | 0  1  0 |
        | 0  0  1 |
    ```
    
    When multiplied with another matrix, the identity matrix leaves the matrix unchanged.
    
3. **Diagonal Matrix**: A diagonal matrix is a square matrix where all the entries outside the main diagonal are zero. The main diagonal is a line of elements from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner. Diagonal matrices are often used to represent scaling operations. Example:
    
    ```python
    D = | 2  0  0 |
        | 0 -1  0 |
        | 0  0  3 |
    ```
    
4. **Upper Triangular Matrix**: An upper triangular matrix has all the entries below the main diagonal equal to zero. The main diagonal and the entries above it can have non-zero values. Example:
    
    ```python
    U = | 1  2  3 |
        | 0  4  5 |
        | 0  0  6 |
    ```
    
5. **Lower Triangular Matrix**: A lower triangular matrix has all the entries above the main diagonal equal to zero. The main diagonal and the entries below it can have non-zero values. Example:
    
    ```python
    L = | 1  0  0 |
        | 4  5  0 |
        | 7  8  9 |
    ```
    
6. **Symmetric Matrix**: A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal to its transpose. The elements across the main diagonal are mirror images of each other. Example:
    
    ```python
    A = | 2  4  6 |
        | 4  5  7 |
        | 6  7  9 |
    ```
    
7. **Orthogonal Matrix**: An orthogonal matrix is a square matrix whose columns and rows are orthogonal unit vectors. The product of an orthogonal matrix and its transpose is the identity matrix. Orthogonal matrices preserve distances, angles, and norms. Example:
    
    ```python
    Q = | 1/‚àö2  -1/‚àö2 |
        | 1/‚àö2   1/‚àö2 |
    ```
    

These are some of the commonly encountered types of matrices in linear algebra. Each type has unique properties and applications in various mathematical and computational contexts.

### Tensors

In mathematics and physics, tensors are mathematical objects that generalize scalars, vectors, and matrices to higher dimensions. They are used to represent and manipulate multilinear relationships between vectors, vectors and scalars, or even higher-dimensional arrays of data. Tensors have a wide range of applications, including physics, engineering, and machine learning.

In the context of machine learning, tensors play a crucial role as they form the fundamental data structures for storing and processing data in deep learning frameworks. Tensors are multidimensional arrays that can store numerical data, such as images, text, and audio, as well as intermediate computations in neural networks.

Here are a few key points about tensors:

1. **Order or Rank**: The order, also known as the rank, of a tensor refers to the number of dimensions it has. For example, a scalar is a 0th-order tensor (rank-0), a vector is a 1st-order tensor (rank-1), and a matrix is a 2nd-order tensor (rank-2). Tensors of higher rank have more dimensions.
    
2. **Shape**: The shape of a tensor defines the size of each dimension. For example, a \\(3\times3\\) matrix has a shape of \\((3, 3)\\), while a \\(3\times3\times3\\) cube of data has a shape of \\((3, 3, 3)\\). The shape of a tensor provides information about its dimensions and the number of elements along each dimension.
    
3. **Elements**: The elements of a tensor are the individual values stored in the tensor. Each element is indexed based on its position within the tensor. For example, in a 2D tensor, an element can be accessed using row and column indices.
    
4. **Tensor Operations**: Tensors support a variety of operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and matrix operations like dot product and transpose. These operations can be applied element-wise or along specific dimensions of the tensor.
    

In Python, tensors are commonly represented using libraries like NumPy or deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. These libraries provide convenient functions and operations for creating, manipulating, and performing computations on tensors.

In Python, tensors can be represented using multi-dimensional NumPy arrays. Here's an example of creating a 3-dimensional tensor using NumPy:

```python
import numpy as np

# Create a 3-dimensional tensor
tensor = np.array([
    [[1, 2, 3],
     [4, 5, 6]],
    
    [[7, 8, 9],
     [10, 11, 12]],
    
    [[13, 14, 15],
     [16, 17, 18]]
])

print(tensor)
```

In this code, we create a 3-dimensional tensor with shape (3, 2, 3). The first dimension represents the "depth" of the tensor, the second dimension represents the number of rows, and the third dimension represents the number of columns.

When you run this code, it will output the tensor:

```python
[[[ 1  2  3]
  [ 4  5  6]]

 [[ 7  8  9]
  [10 11 12]]

 [[13 14 15]
  [16 17 18]]]
```

This represents a 3-dimensional tensor with three "slices", where each slice is a 2x3 matrix. You can access and manipulate the elements of the tensor using indexing and slicing operations provided by NumPy.

Overall, tensors are a fundamental concept in machine learning, enabling efficient storage, manipulation, and computation of multidimensional data. They serve as a foundation for building and training deep learning models that can process complex data structures.

### Matrix Operations

### Addition and Subtraction

Matrix addition and subtraction are operations performed on matrices to combine or modify their corresponding elements. Both operations require the matrices to have the same dimensions.

**Matrix Addition:**

Matrix addition is performed by adding corresponding elements of two matrices together to create a new matrix with the same dimensions. The addition is done element-wise, which means that each element in the resulting matrix is the sum of the corresponding elements from the original matrices.

For example, let's consider two matrices A and B with the same dimensions:

```python
A = | 1  2  3 |    B = | 4  5  6 |
    | 7  8  9 |        | 2  4  6 |
    | 0  1  2 |        | 3  2  1 |
```

The matrix addition of A and B, denoted as A + B, would be:

```python
A + B = | 1+4  2+5  3+6 |
        | 7+2  8+4  9+6 |
        | 0+3  1+2  2+1 |
```

Simplifying the addition gives us:

```python
A + B = | 5  7  9 |
        | 9 12 15 |
        | 3  3  3 |
```

So, the resulting matrix is:

```python
A + B = | 5  7  9 |
        | 9 12 15 |
        | 3  3  3 |
```

**Matrix Subtraction:**

Matrix subtraction is similar to matrix addition but involves subtracting corresponding elements of two matrices instead of adding them. The subtraction is done element-wise, meaning each element in the resulting matrix is the difference between the corresponding elements from the original matrices.

Using the same matrices A and B as above, the matrix subtraction of A and B, denoted as A - B, would be:

```python
A - B = | 1-4  2-5  3-6 |
        | 7-2  8-4  9-6 |
        | 0-3  1-2  2-1 |
```

Simplifying the subtraction gives us:

```python
A - B = | -3  -3  -3 |
        |  5   4   3 |
        | -3  -1   1 |
```

So, the resulting matrix is:

```python
A - B = | -3  -3  -3 |
        |  5   4   3 |
        | -3  -1   1 |
```

Matrix addition and subtraction can be used in various applications, such as solving linear systems, performing transformations, and manipulating data in various fields including mathematics, physics, computer science, and machine learning.

In Python, you can perform matrix addition and subtraction using the NumPy library. Here's an example code that demonstrates matrix addition and subtraction:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrices
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])

B = np.array([[7, 8, 9],
              [10, 11, 12]])

# Perform matrix addition
C = A + B

# Perform matrix subtraction
D = A - B

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Matrix B:\n", B)
print("Matrix C (A + B):\n", C)
print("Matrix D (A - B):\n", D)
```

In this code, we define two matrices `A` and `B` using NumPy arrays. We then use the `+` operator to perform matrix addition and the `-` operator to perform matrix subtraction. The resulting matrices `C` and `D` are stored in separate variables.

When you run this code, it will output the original matrices `A` and `B`, as well as the matrices `C` (result of matrix addition) and `D` (result of matrix subtraction). The output will look like:

```python
Matrix A:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
Matrix B:
 [[ 7  8  9]
 [10 11 12]]
Matrix C (A + B):
 [[ 8 10 12]
 [14 16 18]]
Matrix D (A - B):
 [[-6 -6 -6]
 [-6 -6 -6]]
```

<mark>Note that for matrix addition and subtraction, the matrices must have the same dimensions.</mark> The element-wise operations are performed on corresponding elements of the matrices.

### Multiplication

Matrix multiplication is an operation performed on two matrices to produce a new matrix. Unlike addition and subtraction, matrix multiplication is not element-wise. Instead, it involves multiplying corresponding elements and summing the results.

To multiply two matrices A and B, the number of columns in matrix A must be equal to the number of rows in matrix B. The resulting matrix, denoted as C, will have dimensions determined by the number of rows in A and the number of columns in B.

The general formula for matrix multiplication is:

$$C[i, j] = ‚àë(A[i, k] * B[k, j]) \;\;\;\;for\; k = 1 \;to\; n$$

In this formula, \\(C[i, j]\\) represents the element in the i-th row and j-th column of the resulting matrix \\(C\\). \\(A[i, k]\\) and \\(B[k, j]\\) represent the corresponding elements from matrices A and B, respectively. The summation is performed for all values of \\(k\\) from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of columns in matrix \\(A\\) (or equivalently, the number of rows in matrix \\(B\\)).

Here's an example to illustrate matrix multiplication:

Let's consider two matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\):

```python
A = | 2  3 |    B = | 4  5 |
    | 1  6 |        | 7  8 |
```

To multiply matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), we compute each element of the resulting matrix \\(C\\) using the formula mentioned earlier:

```python
C[1, 1] = (2 * 4) + (3 * 7) = 8 + 21 = 29
C[1, 2] = (2 * 5) + (3 * 8) = 10 + 24 = 34
C[2, 1] = (1 * 4) + (6 * 7) = 4 + 42 = 46
C[2, 2] = (1 * 5) + (6 * 8) = 5 + 48 = 53
```

Thus, the resulting matrix \\(C\\) is:

```python
C = | 29  34 |
    | 46  53 |
```

Matrix multiplication is a fundamental operation in linear algebra and finds numerous applications in various fields, including computer graphics, physics simulations, optimization problems, and machine learning, especially in neural networks.

In Python, you can perform matrix multiplication using the NumPy library. Here's an example code that demonstrates matrix multiplication:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrices
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6]])

B = np.array([[7, 8],
              [9, 10],
              [11, 12]])

# Perform matrix multiplication
C = np.dot(A, B)  # or C = A @ B

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Matrix B:\n", B)
print("Matrix C (A * B):\n", C)
```

In this code, we define two matrices `A` and `B` using NumPy arrays. We then use the [`np.dot`](http://np.dot)`()` function or the `@` operator to perform matrix multiplication. The resulting matrix `C` is stored in a variable.

When you run this code, it will output the original matrices `A` and `B`, as well as the resulting matrix `C` (the product of matrix multiplication). The output will look like:

```python
Matrix A:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]]
Matrix B:
 [[ 7  8]
 [ 9 10]
 [11 12]]
Matrix C (A * B):
 [[ 58  64]
 [139 154]]
```

Note that for matrix multiplication, the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix. The resulting matrix will have dimensions (rows of first matrix) x (columns of second matrix).

#### Geometric Interpretation of Matrix Multiplication

The geometric interpretation of matrix multiplication in the context of linear transformations involves combining and composing transformations.

When we multiply two matrices, let's say matrix \\(A\\) and matrix \\(B\\), the resulting matrix \\(C\\) represents the composition of the linear transformations represented by \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). In other words, applying the transformation represented by matrix \\(B\\) to a vector and then applying the transformation represented by matrix \\(A\\) to the resulting vector is equivalent to applying the transformation represented by matrix \\(C\\) directly.

Here are some geometric interpretations of matrix multiplication:

1. **Transformation Composition**: Suppose matrix \\(A\\) represents a linear transformation that maps vectors from space \\(X\\) to space \\(Y\\), and matrix \\(B\\) represents a linear transformation that maps vectors from space \\(Y\\) to space \\(Z\\). The matrix product \\(C = AB\\) represents a linear transformation that maps vectors directly from space \\(X\\) to space \\(Z\\), combining the transformations represented by \\(A\\) and \\(B\\). Geometrically, this means that applying the composite transformation \\(C\\) is equivalent to applying the individual transformations \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) successively.
    
2. **Stretching, Rotating, and Shearing**: Matrix multiplication can represent various geometric transformations, such as stretching, rotating, and shearing. The elements of the resulting matrix \\(C\\) are obtained by taking dot products of rows from matrix \\(A\\) and columns from matrix \\(B\\). Each element of the resulting matrix \\(C\\) corresponds to the transformation of a specific combination of coordinates. Geometrically, matrix multiplication combines and modifies the input coordinates to produce the transformed coordinates, resulting in stretching, rotation, shearing, or a combination of these transformations.
    
3. **Change of Basis**: In the context of change of basis, matrix multiplication can be interpreted as transforming a vector from one coordinate system to another. The matrices involved in the multiplication represent the transformation between different bases. Geometrically, matrix multiplication maps the vector coordinates from one basis to the corresponding coordinates in another basis, allowing us to express the vector in a different coordinate system.
    
4. **Projection and Subspace Transformations**: Matrix multiplication can also represent projections and transformations between subspaces. For example, the matrix product \\(A^T A\\), where \\(A^T\\) is the transpose of matrix \\(A\\), represents a transformation that projects vectors onto the column space of \\(A\\). Geometrically, this means that matrix multiplication can transform vectors onto lower-dimensional subspaces or project them onto higher-dimensional subspaces.
    

The geometric interpretation of matrix multiplication highlights its role in combining transformations, representing various geometric transformations, changing coordinate systems, and performing projections and subspace transformations.

### Transpose

The transpose of a matrix is an operation that flips the matrix over its main diagonal, resulting in a new matrix where the rows of the original matrix become the columns, and the columns become the rows. The transpose operation is denoted by a superscript "T" or by placing a prime (') after the matrix name.

For a given matrix \\(A\\) with dimensions \\(m \times n,\\) the transpose of \\(A\\), denoted as \\(A^T\\), is a new matrix with dimensions \\(n \times m\\).

To calculate the transpose of a matrix, you simply need to interchange the rows and columns. The element at position \\((i, j)\\) in the original matrix becomes the element at position \\((j, i)\\) in the transposed matrix.

Here's an example to illustrate the transpose operation:

Let's consider the matrix \\(A\\):

```python
A = | 1  2  3 |
    | 4  5  6 |
```

To find the transpose of matrix \\(A (A^T)\\), we interchange the rows and columns:

```python
A^T = | 1  4 |
      | 2  5 |
      | 3  6 |
```

Thus, the resulting matrix \\(A^T\\) is:

```python
A^T = | 1  4 |
      | 2  5 |
      | 3  6 |
```

Some properties of matrix transposition include:

* \\((A^T)^T = A\\) (Transposing a transposed matrix results in the original matrix)
    
* \\((A + B)^T = A^T + B^T\\) (The transpose of a sum of matrices is equal to the sum of their transposes)
    
* \\((kA)^T = kA^T\\) (The transpose of a scalar multiplied by a matrix is equal to the scalar multiplied by the transpose of the matrix)
    

The transpose operation is important in various applications, including solving systems of linear equations, performing transformations, and in matrix operations such as matrix multiplication, eigenvalue calculations, and matrix factorizations.

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
                   [4, 5, 6]])

# Calculate the transpose
transpose_matrix = np.transpose(matrix)

# Print the original matrix
print("Original Matrix:")
for row in matrix:
    print(" ".join(str(element) for element in row))

# Print the transpose matrix
print("\nTranspose Matrix:")
for row in transpose_matrix:
    print(" ".join(str(element) for element in row))
```

In this code, we use the `numpy` library to perform matrix operations. We define the matrix using the `np.array()` function, and then use the `np.transpose()` function to calculate the transpose of the matrix.

The original matrix is printed row by row using a loop, and each element is formatted as a string. Similarly, the transpose matrix is printed row by row with elements formatted as strings.

When you run the code, you'll see the original matrix followed by the transpose matrix printed in a formatted manner.

The output of the above code is here:

```python
Original Matrix:
1 2 3
4 5 6

Transpose Matrix:
1 4
2 5
3 6
```

#### Geometric Interpretation of Transpose of a Matrix

1. **Geometric Interpretation of Transpose for Vectors**: When considering a vector \\(v\\) as a column vector, the transpose of \\(v (v^T)\\) represents the same vector as a row vector. Geometrically, this can be visualized as a rotation of the vector from a vertical orientation to a horizontal orientation.
    
2. **Orthogonal Complement**: The transpose of a matrix also relates to the orthogonal complement of its row space and column space. The row space of a matrix represents the vectors spanned by its rows, while the column space represents the vectors spanned by its columns. The orthogonal complement of the row space is equal to the null space (or kernel) of the matrix, while the orthogonal complement of the column space is equal to the null space of the transpose of the matrix. Geometrically, this implies that the transpose rotates the row vectors to form a basis for the null space of the original matrix.
    
3. **Dot Product Interpretation**: The dot product between two vectors u and v can be expressed as the matrix product \\(u^T v\\), where \\(u^T\\) is the transpose of \\(u\\). Geometrically, the transpose allows us to compute the dot product between two vectors by aligning them in a horizontal orientation.
    
4. **Symmetric Matrices**: For a symmetric matrix \\(A\\), where \\(A^T\\) is equal to \\(A\\), the transpose preserves the matrix's structure. Geometrically, this implies that the original matrix and its transpose represent the same linear transformation, resulting in symmetric properties.
    

The geometric interpretation of the transpose of a matrix highlights its role in transforming vectors from column format to row format, determining orthogonal complements, computing dot products, and preserving symmetry.

### Inverse

The inverse of a square matrix is a matrix that, when multiplied by the original matrix, results in the identity matrix. The inverse of a matrix \\(A\\) is denoted as \\(A^{-1}\\).

To find the inverse of a matrix, it must be square (having the same number of rows and columns) and have a non-zero determinant. The process of finding the inverse involves several steps, such as augmenting the original matrix with the identity matrix, performing row operations to transform the original matrix into the identity matrix, and the resulting augmented matrix will be the inverse.

Let's take an example code that demonstrates how to find the inverse of a matrix using `numpy`:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrix
matrix = np.array([[1, 2],
                   [3, 4]])

# Calculate the inverse
inverse_matrix = np.linalg.inv(matrix)

# Print the original matrix
print("Original Matrix:")
print(matrix)

# Print the inverse matrix
print("\nInverse Matrix:")
print(inverse_matrix)
```

In this code, we import the `numpy` library as `np`. We define the matrix using the `np.array()` function. Then, we use the `np.linalg.inv()` function to calculate the inverse of the matrix.

The original matrix and the inverse matrix are then printed using the `print()` function.

When you run the code, you'll see the original matrix followed by the inverse matrix.

Output of the above code is here:

```python
Original Matrix:
[[1 2]
 [3 4]]

Inverse Matrix:
[[-2.   1. ]
 [ 1.5 -0.5]]
```

<mark>Note that the inverse matrix is not always defined for every matrix</mark>. It exists only for square matrices that are non-singular (having a non-zero determinant). If a matrix is singular or not invertible, the `numpy` function will raise a `LinAlgError`.

#### Geometric Interpretation of Inverse of a Matrix

The geometric perspective of the inverse of a matrix relates to its transformation properties. In the context of linear transformations, the inverse of a matrix represents the reverse transformation.

When a square matrix \\(A\\) represents a linear transformation, its inverse matrix \\(A^{-1} \\) "undoes" the transformation applied by \\(A\\). In other words, if we apply the transformation represented by \\(A\\) to a vector, and then apply the reverse transformation represented by \\(A^{-1}\\) to the result, we should obtain the original vector.

Here are a few geometric interpretations of the inverse of a matrix:

1. **Reversing Transformations**: If matrix \\(A\\) represents a transformation that stretches, rotates, shears, or reflects vectors in space, the inverse matrix \\(A^{-1}\\) will reverse these transformations. Applying \\(A\\) and \\(A^{-1}\\) successively will bring a vector back to its original position.
    
2. **Returning to the Origin**: If we consider a vector \\(v\\) and apply a transformation represented by matrix \\(A\\) to it, the resulting vector \\(Av\\) will be a transformed version of \\(v\\). However, if we apply the inverse transformation represented by \\(A^{-1}\\) to \\(Av\\), the resulting vector \\(A^{-1}(Av)\\) will bring the vector back to its original position, effectively returning it to the origin.
    
3. **Orthogonal Matrices**: For an orthogonal matrix, where \\(A^T\\) (transpose of \\(A\\)) is equal to \\(A^{-1}\\), the inverse matrix performs a rotation and/or reflection. Each column of an orthogonal matrix represents a unit vector, and the inverse matrix \\(A^{-1}\\) rotates these vectors back to their original positions.
    

<mark>It's important to note that not all matrices have an inverse. A matrix must be square and have a non-zero determinant to have an inverse.</mark> If the determinant is zero, the matrix is singular and doesn't have an inverse. Geometrically, this means that the transformation represented by the matrix collapses space or causes overlapping, making it impossible to reverse the transformation.

The geometric perspective of the inverse of a matrix highlights its role in undoing transformations, returning vectors to their original positions, and reversing the effects of linear transformations.

### Trace

The trace of a square matrix is the sum of its diagonal elements. It is denoted as \\(tr(A)\\), where \\(A\\) is the square matrix.

Mathematically, if \\(A\\) is an \\(n \times n\\) matrix, then the trace of \\(A\\), \\(tr(A)\\), is given by:

$$tr(A) = \sum A[i][i] \;\;\;\;for\; i = 1 \;to\; n$$

where \\(A[i][i]\\) represents the element at the i-th row and i-th column of matrix \\(A\\).

Here are a few key properties and interpretations of the trace of a matrix:

1. **Sum of Eigenvalues**: The trace of a matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. Eigenvalues are important in the analysis of linear transformations and have various applications in linear algebra and other fields. The trace provides a convenient way to compute the sum of eigenvalues without explicitly calculating them.
    
2. **Invariance under Similarity Transformations**: The trace of a matrix is invariant under similarity transformations. If two matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are similar (i.e., \\(B = P^{-1}AP\\) for some invertible matrix \\(P\\)), then \\(tr(A) = tr(B)\\). This property is useful in determining whether two matrices are similar and in finding equivalent representations of a matrix.
    
3. **Trace of Matrix Products**: The trace operation is linear, meaning that for two matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) of compatible dimensions, \\(tr(A + B) = tr(A) + tr(B)\\), and \\(tr(kA) = k * tr(A)\\), where \\(k\\) is a scalar. However, the trace of a product of matrices is not commutative, i.e., \\(tr(AB)\\) is not necessarily equal to \\(tr(BA)\\).
    
4. **Geometric Interpretation**: The trace of a matrix has various geometric interpretations depending on the context. For example, in the context of linear transformations, the trace can represent the sum of the scaling factors along the principal axes of the transformation. In computer graphics, the trace can represent the sum of the diagonal elements of a transformation matrix, which affects scaling, rotation, and translation operations.
    

The geometric interpretation of the trace of a matrix can be visualized by considering the scaling along the principal axes of a linear transformation. Here's a Python code snippet to demonstrate this geometric interpretation and visualize it:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the matrix
matrix = np.array([[2, 0],
                   [0, 3]])

# Calculate the trace
trace = np.trace(matrix)

# Generate a random vector
v = np.random.rand(2, 1)

# Apply the transformation
transformed_v = matrix @ v

# Plot the original and transformed vectors
plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plt.scatter(0, 0, color='red', label='Original Vector')
plt.scatter(v[0], v[1], color='blue', label='Transformed Vector')
plt.scatter(transformed_v[0], transformed_v[1], color='green', label='Scaled Vector')

# Set plot limits
plt.xlim(-5, 5)
plt.ylim(-5, 5)

# Add axes
plt.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
plt.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)

In this code, we start by defining a \\(2\times2\\) matrix with scaling factors along the principal axes. We then generate a random vector `v`. Next, we apply the transformation represented by the matrix to `v` to obtain `transformed_v`.

We use matplotlib to create a scatter plot and visualize the vectors. The original vector is shown in red, the transformed vector is shown in blue, and the scaled vector is shown in green.

The trace of the matrix is displayed as text on the plot.

When you run the code, it will display a scatter plot showing the original vector, the transformed vector, and the scaled vector. The trace value is also shown as text on the plot.

The plot visually demonstrates the geometric interpretation of the trace, showcasing the scaling effect along the principal axes of the linear transformation represented by the matrix.

The trace of a matrix provides valuable information about the matrix and its associated linear transformations. It is used in various areas, including eigenvalue computations, matrix similarity, matrix decompositions, and geometric interpretations of transformations.

### Determinant

The determinant of a square matrix is a scalar value that provides important information about the matrix and its associated linear transformation. It is denoted as \\(det(A)\\) or \\(|A|\\), where \\(A\\) is the square matrix.

The determinant can be calculated for square matrices of any size but is commonly used for \\(2\times2\\) and \\(3\times3\\) matrices. For higher-dimensional matrices, the calculation becomes more involved.

Here are some key properties and interpretations of the determinant:

1. **Area or Volume Scaling**: For a \\(2\times2\\) matrix, the determinant represents the scaling factor for the area of a parallelogram formed by the column vectors of the matrix. For a \\(3\times3\\) matrix, the determinant represents the scaling factor for the volume of a parallelepiped formed by the column vectors of the matrix. If the determinant is zero, it indicates that the vectors are linearly dependent, resulting in a collapsed or degenerate shape.
    
2. **Orientation and Reflection**: The sign of the determinant indicates whether the linear transformation represented by the matrix preserves or reverses orientation. A positive determinant corresponds to preserving orientation, while a negative determinant corresponds to reversing orientation. The magnitude of the determinant indicates the amount of scaling or stretching.
    
3. **Linear Independence**: The determinant provides information about the linear independence of vectors. If the determinant is non-zero, it implies that the vectors forming the matrix are linearly independent, and the matrix is full rank. If the determinant is zero, it indicates that the vectors are linearly dependent, and the matrix is rank deficient.
    
4. **Invertibility**: A square matrix is invertible (non-singular) if and only if its determinant is non-zero. If the determinant is zero, the matrix is non-invertible (singular) and does not have an inverse.
    
5. **Matrix Operations**: The determinant has various properties related to matrix operations. For example, the determinant of a product of matrices is equal to the product of their determinants. Additionally, the determinant of the transpose of a matrix is equal to the determinant of the original matrix.
    

Let's take an example code that demonstrates how to calculate the determinant:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4]])

# Calculate the determinant
det = np.linalg.det(A)

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Determinant of A:", det)
```

In this code, we define a matrix `A` using a NumPy array. We then use the `np.linalg.det()` function to compute the determinant of matrix `A`. The determinant value is stored in a variable called `det`.

When you run this code, it will output the original matrix `A` and the calculated determinant value. The output will look like:

```python
Matrix A:
 [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
Determinant of A: -2.0
```

Note that the `np.linalg.det()` function can only compute the determinant for square matrices. If the matrix is not square or is singular, the function will raise a `LinAlgError`.

The determinant plays a crucial role in many areas of mathematics, including linear algebra, calculus, and geometry. It provides information about scaling, orientation, linear independence, invertibility, and matrix operations.

## Vector Spaces

### Definition and Properties

In mathematics, a vector space is a collection of vectors along with defined operations that satisfy certain properties. Vector spaces provide a framework for studying and analyzing vectors, which are fundamental objects in linear algebra.

Here are the key properties and characteristics of a vector space:

1. **Closure under Addition**: For any two vectors \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in the vector space, their sum \\(u + v\\) is also in the vector space. This property ensures that the result of adding two vectors remains within the same space.
    
2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: For any vector \\(u\\) in the vector space and any scalar \\(c\\), the scalar multiple \\(c * u\\) is also in the vector space. This property guarantees that scaling a vector by a scalar does not take it outside of the space.
    
3. **Existence of a Zero Vector**: Every vector space contains a unique vector called the zero vector (0) that acts as an additive identity. Adding the zero vector to any vector does not change its value.
    
4. **Existence of Additive Inverses**: For every vector u in the vector space, there exists a unique vector \\(-u\\) (or \\(u\\) with a negative sign) such that \\(u + (-u) = 0\\). This property ensures that every vector has an additive inverse.
    
5. **Associativity of Addition**: Addition of vectors is associative, meaning that \\((u + v) + w = u + (v + w)\\) for any vectors \\(u, v,\\) and \\(w\\) in the vector space. This property allows us to group vector additions without changing the result.
    
6. **Commutativity of Addition**: Addition of vectors is commutative, meaning that \\(u + v = v + u\\) for any vectors \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in the vector space. This property implies that the order of adding vectors does not affect the result.
    
7. **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication over Vector Addition**: Scalar multiplication distributes over vector addition, meaning that \\(c (u + v) = c *u + c * v\\) for any scalar \\(c\\) and vectors \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) in the vector space. This property allows us to distribute scalar multiplication across vector additions.
    
8. **Distributivity of Scalar Multiplication over Scalar Addition**: Scalar multiplication distributes over scalar addition, meaning that \\((c + d) u = c*u + d * u\\) for any scalars \\(c\\) and d and vector u in the vector space. This property allows us to distribute scalar multiplication across scalar additions.
    
9. **Compatibility of Scalar Multiplication**: Scalar multiplication is compatible with scalar multiplication, meaning that \\((c d) u = c (d u)\\) for any scalars \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) and vector \\(u\\) in the vector space. This property ensures that scalar multiplication is associative.
    

These properties collectively define the structure of a vector space and allow us to perform various operations and manipulations on vectors. Vector spaces provide a fundamental framework for studying linear algebra, as they capture the essential properties and behaviors of vectors and their operations.

### Linear Independence and Dependence

In linear algebra, the concepts of linear independence and linear dependence refer to the relationships between vectors within a vector space. These terms describe how vectors are related to each other and whether they can be expressed as a combination of other vectors.

Let's define these concepts in a more intuitive way:

1. **Linear Independence**: Vectors are linearly independent if none of them can be expressed as a combination of the others. In other words, no vector in the set can be written as a linear combination of the remaining vectors. Each vector in a linearly independent set carries unique information and cannot be redundant or redundant to any other vector.
    
2. **Linear Dependence**: Vectors are linearly dependent if at least one vector can be expressed as a combination of the others. In this case, one or more vectors in the set can be written as linear combinations of the remaining vectors. This means that some vectors in the set are not providing new or independent information but can be generated by combining other vectors.
    

To understand linear independence and dependence more concretely, consider the following examples:

#### Example 1

Let's say we have two vectors in a two-dimensional space: v1 = \[1, 0\] and v2 = \[2, 0\]. These vectors lie on the x-axis and are collinear. Since one vector can be obtained by scaling the other (v2 = 2 \* v1), they are linearly dependent.

#### Example 2

Now, consider three vectors in three-dimensional space: v1 = \[1, 0, 0\], v2 = \[0, 1, 0\], and v3 = \[0, 0, 1\]. These vectors represent the standard basis vectors along the x, y, and z axes, respectively. Each vector is orthogonal to the others and cannot be expressed as a combination of the remaining vectors. Therefore, they are linearly independent.

The linear independence or dependence of a set of vectors has important implications in linear algebra:

* Linearly independent vectors provide a basis for the vector space. They form a set of fundamental building blocks that can be used to express any vector within that space uniquely.
    
* Linearly dependent vectors can be reduced to a smaller set of independent vectors by removing redundant vectors. This reduction simplifies computations and reveals the essential components of the vector space.
    
* The linear independence or dependence of vectors affects the solvability and uniqueness of systems of linear equations.
    

Let's consider the examples I mentioned earlier and visualize them.

Example 1: Linearly Dependent Vectors

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the vectors
v1 = np.array([1, 0])
v2 = np.array([2, 0])

# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the vectors
ax.quiver(0, 0, v1[0], v1[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='blue', label='v1')
ax.quiver(0, 0, v2[0], v2[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='red', label='v2')

# Set plot limits
ax.set_xlim([-3, 3])
ax.set_ylim([-1, 1])

# Add gridlines
ax.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
ax.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)

# Add legend
ax.legend()

# Add title and labels
ax.set_title('Linearly Dependent Vectors')
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')

plt.show()
```

![linear dependence example](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1686927258795/02ad8147-bb17-417f-8243-c0454ef0da6c.png align="center")

This code will plot the two vectors `v1` and `v2` as arrows on a 2D plane. Since `v2` is a scaled version of `v1`, the vectors are collinear, indicating linear dependence. The plot will show both vectors originating from the origin (0, 0).

Example 2: Linearly Independent Vectors

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the vectors
v1 = np.array([1, 0, 0])
v2 = np.array([0, 1, 0])
v3 = np.array([0, 0, 1])

# Create a 3D figure and axis
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the vectors
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, v1[0], v1[1], v1[2], color='blue', label='v1')
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, v2[0], v2[1], v2[2], color='red', label='v2')
ax.quiver(0, 0, 0, v3[0], v3[1], v3[2], color='green', label='v3')

# Set plot limits
ax.set_xlim([0, 1])
ax.set_ylim([0, 1])
ax.set_zlim([0, 1])

# Add gridlines
ax.grid(False)

# Add legend
ax.legend()

# Add title and labels
ax.set_title('Linearly Independent Vectors')
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
ax.set_zlabel('z')

plt.show()
```

This code will create a 3D plot showing the three vectors `v1`, `v2`, and `v3` as arrows originating from the origin (0, 0, 0). These vectors are orthogonal to each other, representing the standard basis vectors in three-dimensional space, and indicating linear independence.

Running these code snippets will display the plots visualizing the linear independence and dependence of the vectors.

In summary, linear independence and dependence describe whether vectors in a set are redundant or provide unique information. Linearly independent vectors form a basis, while linearly dependent vectors can be expressed as combinations of others. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving problems involving vector spaces, transformations, and systems of equations.

### Basis and Dimension

In linear algebra, a basis is a set of vectors that are linearly independent and span a vector space. It provides a way to represent any vector in the vector space as a unique combination of the basis vectors. The concept of a basis is closely related to the idea of linear independence and dependence that we discussed earlier.

Here's a more intuitive explanation of basis and dimension:

#### **Basis**

A basis is like a set of building blocks that can be used to construct any vector within a vector space. Think of it as a set of vectors that are not redundant and capture the essential directions or dimensions of the vector space.

* A basis must be linearly independent, meaning that none of the vectors in the basis can be expressed as a combination of the others. Each basis vector carries unique information and represents a distinct direction or component.
    
* A basis must span the vector space, meaning that any vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of the basis vectors. Every vector can be built by combining appropriate amounts of each basis vector.
    

#### **Dimension**

The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for that space. It represents the minimum number of independent vectors needed to span the entire space.

* For example, in a two-dimensional space, a basis could consist of two linearly independent vectors. These vectors span the entire space, and any other vector in the space can be expressed as a linear combination of those basis vectors. Therefore, the dimension of the space is 2.
    
* In a three-dimensional space, a basis could consist of three linearly independent vectors. These vectors capture the essential directions in the space, and any vector can be represented as a combination of those basis vectors. Thus, the dimension of the space is 3.
    

The dimension of a vector space provides information about the "size" or complexity of the space. It indicates how many independent components or degrees of freedom are required to describe vectors within that space. The concept of dimension is crucial in understanding the structure and properties of vector spaces.

To summarize, a basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that span a vector space, enabling us to represent any vector in that space as a unique combination of basis vectors. The dimension of a vector space is the number of vectors in any basis for that space, representing the minimum number of independent vectors needed to span the entire space.

### Subspaces

In linear algebra, a subspace is a subset of a vector space that retains the essential structure and properties of the larger space. It is a space within a space, consisting of vectors that satisfy certain conditions. Subspaces provide a way to explore and understand specific subsets of a vector space.

Here's an explanation of subspaces in a more intuitive manner:

**Subspace**: A subspace is like a smaller, self-contained universe within a larger vector space. It is formed by taking a subset of vectors from the original space that satisfy certain properties.

To be considered a subspace, a subset must satisfy three conditions:

1. **Closure under Addition**: If two vectors are in the subspace, their sum must also be in the subspace. In other words, adding any two vectors from the subset will still result in a vector that belongs to the subset.
    
2. **Closure under Scalar Multiplication**: If a vector is in the subspace, multiplying it by a scalar will still yield a vector that belongs to the subspace. Scaling any vector in the subset will not take it out of the subset.
    
3. **Contains the Zero Vector**: The subspace must contain the zero vector, which is the additive identity element of the vector space. This ensures that the subset does not "lose" any essential part of the larger space.
    

**Examples of Subspaces**:

1. The **column space** of a matrix is a subspace of the vector space of all column vectors. It consists of all possible linear combinations of the columns of the matrix.
    
2. The **null space** of a matrix is a subspace of the vector space of all column vectors. It consists of all vectors that satisfy the equation \\(Ax = 0\\), where \\(A\\) is the matrix and \\(x\\) is a column vector.
    
3. The **span** of a set of vectors forms a subspace. The span is the set of all possible linear combinations of the vectors in the set.
    

Subspaces are useful because they retain certain properties and characteristics of the larger vector space while allowing us to focus on specific aspects or dimensions. They enable us to analyze and manipulate smaller subsets of vectors with their own unique properties.

Understanding subspaces helps us solve systems of linear equations, find bases and dimensions, and explore the structure of vector spaces in a more focused and manageable way.

Let's learn the concept of subspaces with some numerical examples.

Example 1: Column Space

Consider the matrix A:

```python
A = [[1, 2],
     [3, 4],
     [5, 6]]
```

The column space of \\(A\\) is the subspace formed by all possible linear combinations of the columns of \\(A\\). To find the column space, we can consider the columns of \\(A\\) as individual vectors and determine their span.

In this case, the first column \[1, 3, 5\] and the second column \[2, 4, 6\] are linearly dependent because the second column is a scaled version of the first column. Thus, the column space of A is the subspace spanned by the first column.

Example 2: Null Space

Continuing from the previous example, let's find the null space of matrix \\(A\\). The null space is the subspace of vectors that satisfy the equation \\(Ax = 0\\), where \\(A\\) is the matrix and \\(x\\) is a column vector.

We can solve the equation \\(Ax = 0\\) using Gaussian elimination or other methods. In this case, we obtain the following row-reduced echelon form:

```python
[1, 0]   [0]
[0, 1] * [0]
[0, 0]   [0]
```

The solution to the system is x = \[0, 0\], meaning the only vector in the null space is the zero vector \[0, 0\].

Example 3: Span

Consider the following set of vectors:

```python
v1 = [1, 2, 3]
v2 = [2, 4, 6]
```

The span of these vectors is the subspace formed by all possible linear combinations of v1 and v2. We can express any vector within this subspace as a linear combination of v1 and v2.

In this case, since v2 is a scaled version of v1, the span of these vectors is the subspace formed by all multiples of v1. Any vector in this subspace can be written as a scalar multiple of v1.

Numerical examples like these help illustrate the concept of subspaces in a concrete manner. They show how certain sets of vectors can form subspaces within the larger vector space, and how those subspaces retain specific properties like closure under addition and scalar multiplication. Understanding subspaces allows us to study and analyze vector spaces in a more focused and structured way.

### Span and Linear Combinations

**Span**: The span of a set of vectors is the set of all possible linear combinations of those vectors. It represents the subspace that can be formed by combining the vectors in various proportions.

Let's take an example to illustrate the concept of span. Suppose we have two vectors:

```python
v1 = [1, 2]
v2 = [3, 4]
```

The span of these vectors, denoted as span(v1, v2), is the set of all possible vectors that can be obtained by scaling and adding v1 and v2. In this case, the span(v1, v2) would consist of all vectors of the form:

```python
c1 * v1 + c2 * v2
```

where c1 and c2 are scalar coefficients.

By varying the coefficients c1 and c2, we can generate different vectors within the span. For example, if we set c1 = 1 and c2 = 2, we get:

```python
1 * v1 + 2 * v2 = [1, 2] + 2 * [3, 4] = [7, 10]
```

Similarly, we can obtain other vectors within the span by choosing different values for c1 and c2.

**Linear Combination**: A linear combination of vectors involves multiplying each vector by a scalar coefficient and adding them together. It is a way of combining vectors while preserving the linearity property.

Using the previous example, let's define a linear combination of vectors v1 and v2:

```python
c1 * v1 + c2 * v2
```

This expression represents a linear combination of v1 and v2, where c1 and c2 are scalar coefficients. Each vector is scaled by its corresponding coefficient and then added together.

Linear combinations allow us to explore different combinations of vectors and obtain new vectors within their span. By adjusting the coefficients, we can move along different directions and explore different points in the vector space.

The concept of span and linear combinations is fundamental in linear algebra as they help us understand the subspace formed by a set of vectors and how various vectors can be combined to generate new vectors within that subspace.

Let's visualize the concepts of span and linear combinations using Python and the Matplotlib library. We'll consider a two-dimensional vector space for simplicity.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the vectors
v1 = np.array([1, 2])
v2 = np.array([3, 4])

# Generate coefficients for linear combinations
c1 = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)
c2 = np.linspace(-2, 2, 10)

# Create a figure and axis
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Plot the vectors v1 and v2
ax.quiver(0, 0, v1[0], v1[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='blue', label='v1')
ax.quiver(0, 0, v2[0], v2[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='red', label='v2')

# Plot the linear combinations
for coeff1 in c1:
    for coeff2 in c2:
        linear_combination = coeff1 * v1 + coeff2 * v2
        ax.quiver(0, 0, linear_combination[0], linear_combination[1], angles='xy', scale_units='xy', scale=1, color='green', alpha=0.3)

# Set plot limits
ax.set_xlim([-10, 10])
ax.set_ylim([-10, 10])

# Add gridlines
ax.axhline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)
ax.axvline(0, color='black', linewidth=0.5)

# Add legend
ax.legend()

# Add title and labels
ax.set_title('Span and Linear Combinations')
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')

plt.show()
```

In this code, we define two vectors `v1` and `v2`. We then generate a range of coefficients `c1` and `c2` to create various linear combinations of `v1` and `v2`. For each pair of coefficients, we calculate the corresponding linear combination vector. These linear combinations are then plotted as arrows on a 2D plane.

Running this code will display a visualization that demonstrates the span of vectors `v1` and `v2`, as well as the various linear combinations obtained by scaling and adding these vectors. The green arrows represent the resulting vectors of different linear combinations.

You can adjust the range and granularity of the coefficients `c1` and `c2` to explore a wider range of linear combinations and observe their effect on the spanned vector space.

## Linear Transformations

### Definition and Properties

In the context of linear algebra, a linear transformation is a mapping or function between vector spaces that preserves the algebraic properties of vector addition and scalar multiplication. It takes a vector as input and produces another vector as output while maintaining the linearity property.

More formally, a linear transformation T from a vector space V to a vector space W can be defined as follows:

For any vectors u and v in V and any scalar c:

1. T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v) (Preservation of vector addition)
    
2. T(c *u) = c* T(u) (Preservation of scalar multiplication)
    

These properties imply that the linear transformation T preserves the structure of vector addition and scalar multiplication in both the domain and the codomain. It means that the transformation does not distort or change the geometry of vectors in any way, but rather preserves their linear relationships.

Geometrically, a linear transformation can stretch, rotate, shear, or reflect vectors in space, while maintaining the property of linearity. It can change the orientation, shape, and size of vectors, but the relationships between vectors and their linear combinations remain intact.

Linear transformations play a fundamental role in various areas of mathematics and applied fields, including computer graphics, computer vision, machine learning, and physics. They provide a powerful tool to analyze and manipulate vectors and vector spaces while preserving their underlying linear structure.

Linear transformations possess several important properties that make them a fundamental concept in linear algebra. Let's explore some key properties of linear transformations:

1. **Preservation of Vector Addition**: A linear transformation preserves the addition of vectors. For any vectors u and v in the domain, T(u + v) = T(u) + T(v). This property ensures that the transformation maintains the relationship between vectors' sum.
    
2. **Preservation of Scalar Multiplication**: A linear transformation preserves scalar multiplication. For any vector u in the domain and scalar c, T(c *u) = c* T(u). This property guarantees that scaling a vector before or after the transformation yields the same result.
    
3. **Preservation of the Zero Vector**: A linear transformation maps the zero vector in the domain to the zero vector in the codomain. T(0) = 0, where 0 represents the zero vector.
    
4. **Linearity**: A linear transformation is linear, meaning it satisfies the two properties mentioned above: preservation of vector addition and scalar multiplication. These properties ensure that the transformation preserves the linear structure of the vector space.
    
5. **Matrix Representation**: Every linear transformation from one finite-dimensional vector space to another can be represented by a matrix. The matrix representation allows us to perform computations and apply the transformation efficiently.
    
6. **Composition of Linear Transformations**: The composition of two linear transformations is also a linear transformation. If T1 and T2 are linear transformations, then the composition T2(T1) is also a linear transformation.
    
7. **Image and Kernel**: The image of a linear transformation is the set of all possible outputs or vectors in the codomain that can be obtained by applying the transformation to vectors in the domain. The kernel, also known as the null space, is the set of vectors in the domain that are mapped to the zero vector in the codomain.
    
8. **Invertibility**: A linear transformation is invertible if there exists a unique inverse transformation that undoes the effect of the original transformation. Invertible linear transformations are bijective, meaning they are both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).
    

These properties highlight the significance of linear transformations in preserving vector relationships, allowing for efficient computation, and providing a framework for analyzing vector spaces and their structural properties.

### Matrix Representation of Linear Transformations

The matrix representation of a linear transformation allows us to represent and work with the transformation using matrices. It provides a concise and efficient way to perform computations and apply the transformation to vectors. The matrix representation depends on the choice of bases for the domain and codomain vector spaces.

Let's consider a linear transformation \\(T: V \rightarrow W\\), where \\(V\\) and \\(W\\) are finite-dimensional vector spaces.

1. Choose bases: Select bases for \\(V\\) and \\(W\\). Let's say the basis for \\(V\\) is \\({v_1, v_2, ..., v_n}\\) and the basis for \\(W\\) is \\({w_1, w_2, ..., w_m}\\).
    
2. Matrix representation: The matrix representation of \\(T\\), denoted as \\([T]\\), is an \\(m \times n\\) matrix, where \\(m\\) is the dimension of the codomain \\(W\\) and \\(n\\) is the dimension of the domain \\(V\\).
    
3. Column vectors: Each column of \\([T]\\) represents the images of the basis vectors of \\(V\\) under the transformation \\(T\\). To obtain the j-th column, apply \\(T\\) to the j-th basis vector of \\(V\\) and express the result in terms of the basis vectors of \\(W\\). Write this result as a column vector.
    
4. Coordinate vectors: Given a vector \\(v\\) in \\(V\\), express \\(v\\) as a linear combination of the basis vectors of \\(V\\). The coefficients of this linear combination form a column vector, which we'll denote as \\([v]\\) (the coordinate vector of \\(v\\) with respect to the basis of \\(V\\)).
    
5. Applying the transformation: To apply the linear transformation \\(T\\) to a vector \\(v\\), calculate the matrix-vector product \\([T] * [v]\\). This yields a column vector in the codomain \\(W\\), which represents the image of \\(v\\) under \\(T\\).
    
6. Linear transformation properties: The matrix representation of \\(T\\) preserves various properties of the linear transformation, such as the preservation of vector addition and scalar multiplication.
    

Note that the choice of bases affects the specific matrix representation of \\(T\\). Different choices of bases may yield different matrices representing the same linear transformation.

By utilizing the matrix representation, we can efficiently compute the effect of the linear transformation on vectors, perform composition of transformations using matrix multiplication, and analyze properties of the transformation using matrix operations.

Let's consider a numerical example to illustrate the matrix representation of a linear transformation.

Suppose we have the linear transformation \\(T: R^2 \rightarrow R^3\\) defined as follows: \\(T(x, y) = (2x + y, x - 3y, 4x + 2y)\\)

To find the matrix representation of \\(T\\), we need to choose bases for both the domain \\(R^2\\) and the codomain \\(R^3\\). Let's select the standard basis for both spaces:

Basis for \\(R^2: {(1, 0), (0, 1)}\\)

Basis for \\(R^3: {(1, 0, 0), (0, 1, 0), (0, 0, 1)}\\)

Now, let's determine the matrix \\([T]\\) representing the linear transformation \\(T\\).

To find the first column of \\([T]\\), we apply \\(T\\) to the first basis vector of \\(R^2: T(1, 0) = (21 + 0, 1 - 30, 41 + 20) = (2, 1, 4)\\)

Expressing this result in terms of the basis for \\(R^3\\), the first column of \\([T]\\) is \\((2, 1, 4)\\).

Similarly, for the second column of \\([T]\\), we apply \\(T\\) to the second basis vector of \\(R^2: T(0, 1) = (20 + 1, 0 - 31, 40 + 21) = (1, -3, 2)\\)

Expressing this result in terms of the basis for \\(R^3\\), the second column of \\([T]\\) is \\((1, -3, 2)\\).

Therefore, the matrix representation \\([T]\\) of the linear transformation \\(T\\) is:

```python
[T] = | 2 1 | 
      | 1 -3 | 
      | 4 2 |
```

To apply the linear transformation to a vector \\(v = (x, y)\\), we calculate the matrix-vector product

```python
[T] * [v] = 
| 2 1 |    | x |
| 1 -3 | * | y |
| 4 2 |
```

For example, let's apply \\(T\\) to the vector \\(v = (1, 2)\\):

```python
[T] * [v] = 
| 2 1 |    | 1 |
| 1 -3 | * | 2 |
| 4 2 |
```

Performing the matrix multiplication, we get:

```python
[T] * [v] = 
| 5 |
| -5 |
| 8 |
```

Therefore, the image of the vector \\(v = (1, 2)\\) under the linear transformation \\(T\\) is \\((5, -5, 8)\\).

The matrix representation of a linear transformation allows us to perform computations using matrices, such as matrix-vector products and matrix operations, to efficiently apply and analyze the effects of the transformation.

Here's a Python code snippet that visualizes the linear transformation T and applies it to a vector:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the linear transformation T: R^2 -> R^3
def linear_transformation(x, y):
    return np.array([2*x + y, x - 3*y, 4*x + 2*y])

# Create a grid of points in the domain R^2
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 20)
y = np.linspace(-5, 5, 20)
X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

# Apply the linear transformation to the grid points
U, V, W = linear_transformation(X, Y)

# Create a 3D plot
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')

# Plot the original grid points
ax.plot_surface(X, Y, np.zeros_like(X), color='blue', alpha=0.3)

# Plot the transformed points
ax.plot_surface(U, V, W, color='red', alpha=0.8)

# Set plot limits and labels
ax.set_xlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_ylim(-10, 10)
ax.set_zlim(-10, 10)
ax.set_xlabel('X')
ax.set_ylabel('Y')
ax.set_zlabel('Z')

# Add a title
ax.set_title('Linear Transformation T: R^2 -> R^3')

# Display the plot
plt.show()
```

This code visualizes the linear transformation \\(T\\) from \\(R^2\\) to \\(R^3\\) by applying it to a grid of points in the domain. The transformed points are plotted in a 3D space.

To see the visualization, simply run the code. It will show the original grid points in blue and the transformed points in red, representing the image of the linear transformation. You can rotate and zoom in/out the plot to explore the transformed vectors in 3D.

Note that you might need to install the `matplotlib` library if you haven't already. You can use the following command to install it:

```python
pip install matplotlib
```

Feel free to adjust the parameters, such as the range and density of the grid points, to customize the visualization according to your needs.

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important concepts in linear algebra that play a significant role in the analysis of linear transformations and matrices. Let's explain eigenvalues and eigenvectors and their properties:

**Eigenvalues**: For a given linear transformation \\(T\\) or a square matrix \\(A\\), an eigenvalue represents a scalar \\(\lambda\\) such that when \\(T\\) or \\(A\\) is applied to a corresponding eigenvector, the result is a scalar multiple of the eigenvector. In other words, the eigenvector remains in the same direction (up to scaling) after the transformation. Mathematically, we can represent this as: \\(T(v) = Œª v \;\;or\;\; A v = Œª * v\\).

**Eigenvectors**: An eigenvector is a non-zero vector v that, when multiplied by a matrix A or transformed by a linear transformation \\(T\\), yields a scalar multiple of itself. The scalar multiple is known as the eigenvalue corresponding to that eigenvector. Eigenvectors associated with distinct eigenvalues are linearly independent, which means they span different directions in the vector space.

Imagine you have a transformation (like stretching, rotating, or shearing) that acts on vectors in a space. An eigenvector is a special vector that remains in the same direction after the transformation, although it may change in length.

Eigenvalues, on the other hand, represent how much the eigenvector is scaled or stretched by the transformation. They indicate the factor by which the eigenvector is expanded or contracted.

To put it simply, eigenvectors are the special vectors that stay in the same direction even after a transformation, and eigenvalues tell us how much those eigenvectors are stretched or shrunk.

In applications such as machine learning, eigenvalues and eigenvectors are important because they provide valuable insights into the characteristics of a matrix or a transformation. They can help identify important features or patterns in data, determine the stability of systems, and simplify complex calculations.

I hope this explanation helps in understanding eigenvalues and eigenvectors in a more straightforward way!

Here are a few numerical examples to illustrate the concepts of eigenvalues and eigenvectors:

#### Example 1: Scaling Transformation

Consider a scaling transformation that doubles the length of a vector while keeping its direction fixed. Let's say we have a matrix:

```python
A = [[2, 0],
     [0, 2]]
```

The eigenvectors of this matrix would be any non-zero vector along the x-axis or y-axis, such as \[1, 0\] or \[0, 1\]. The corresponding eigenvalue for both eigenvectors would be 2 since the vectors are doubled in length by the transformation.

#### Example 2: Rotation Transformation

Now, let's consider a rotation transformation that rotates a vector counterclockwise by 90 degrees. We have the following matrix:

```python
B = [[0, -1],
     [1,  0]]
```

The eigenvectors of this matrix would be the unit vectors along the x-axis and y-axis, \[1, 0\] and \[0, 1\], respectively. These eigenvectors remain unchanged in direction after the rotation transformation. The corresponding eigenvalues for both eigenvectors would be complex numbers, i.e., 1j and -1j.

#### Example 3: Shearing Transformation

Lastly, let's explore a shearing transformation that shifts the x-coordinate of a vector based on its y-coordinate. Consider the matrix:

```python
C = [[1, 2],
     [0, 1]]
```

In this case, the eigenvector along the x-axis, \[1, 0\], remains in the same direction after the shearing transformation. Its corresponding eigenvalue is 1 since there is no scaling involved. However, there is no eigenvector along the y-axis that remains unchanged under this transformation.

These examples showcase different types of transformations and their corresponding eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Eigenvectors provide insight into the direction of vectors that remain unchanged, while eigenvalues indicate the scaling or stretching factor associated with those eigenvectors.

**Properties**:

1. **Eigenvalue Equation**: The eigenvalue equation is represented as \\((A - ŒªI) v = 0\\)*,* where \\(A\\) is the matrix, \\(\lambda\\) is the eigenvalue, \\(v\\) is the eigenvector, and \\(I\\) is the identity matrix of the same dimension as A. The equation \\((A - \lambda I) v = 0\\) must hold for a non-zero eigenvector \\(v\\).
    
2. **Eigenvalue Multiplicity**: An eigenvalue may have a multiplicity greater than 1, which indicates that it has multiple linearly independent eigenvectors associated with it.
    
3. **Eigenvalue Spectrum**: The set of all eigenvalues of a matrix or a linear transformation is known as the eigenvalue spectrum.
    
4. **Eigenspace**: The eigenspace corresponding to an eigenvalue \\(\lambda\\) is the set of all eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. It forms a subspace of the vector space.
    
5. **Diagonalization**: A square matrix \\(A\\) can be diagonalized if it has a full set of linearly independent eigenvectors. Diagonalization involves finding a diagonal matrix \\(D\\) and an invertible matrix \\(P\\) such that \\(A = PDP^{-1}\\), where \\(D\\) contains the eigenvalues on the diagonal, and \\(P\\) contains the corresponding eigenvectors as its columns.
    

In Python, you can compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix using the NumPy library. Here's an example code that demonstrates how to calculate them:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4]])

# Compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Eigenvalues:", eigenvalues)
print("Eigenvectors:\n", eigenvectors)
```

In this code, we define a matrix `A` using a NumPy array. We then use the `np.linalg.eig()` function to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix `A`. The eigenvalues are stored in a NumPy array called `eigenvalues`, and the eigenvectors are stored in a NumPy array called `eigenvectors`.

When you run this code, it will output the original matrix `A`, the computed eigenvalues, and the corresponding eigenvectors. The output will look like:

```python
Matrix A:
 [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
Eigenvalues: [-0.37228132  5.37228132]
Eigenvectors:
 [[-0.82456484 -0.41597356]
 [ 0.56576746 -0.90937671]]
```

The eigenvalues represent the scaling factors for the corresponding eigenvectors. Each column in the `eigenvectors` array corresponds to an eigenvector.

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors have various applications in fields such as physics, computer science, data analysis, and signal processing. They provide valuable insights into the behavior and characteristics of linear transformations and matrices. They also help in solving systems of linear equations, analyzing the stability of dynamic systems, and performing dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

### Diagonalization and Similarity Transformations

Diagonalization and similarity transformations are concepts related to linear transformations and matrices. Let's explain these concepts:

**Diagonalization**: Diagonalization is the process of finding a diagonal matrix \\(D\\) and an invertible matrix \\(P\\) such that the matrix \\(A\\) can be expressed as the product of \\(P\\), \\(D\\), and the inverse of \\(P\\). Mathematically, it can be represented as:

$$A = PDP^{-1}$$

where \\(A\\) is a square matrix, \\(D\\) is a diagonal matrix, and \\(P\\) is an invertible matrix composed of the eigenvectors of \\(A\\). The diagonal matrix \\(D\\) contains the eigenvalues of \\(A\\) on its diagonal. Diagonalization is useful because it simplifies computations involving matrix powers, matrix exponentiation, and solving systems of linear differential equations.

**Similarity Transformations**: A similarity transformation is a linear transformation applied to a matrix \\(A\\), resulting in a new matrix \\(B\\). The two matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are said to be similar if there exists an invertible matrix \\(P\\) such that:

$$B = PAP^{ -1}$$

In other words, \\(B\\) is obtained by transforming \\(A\\) through a change of basis defined by the matrix \\(P\\). Similarity transformations preserve certain properties of matrices, such as eigenvalues, determinant, rank, and trace. They are useful in analyzing the structural properties of matrices and understanding the relationship between different matrices.

**Relationship between Diagonalization and Similarity Transformations**: Diagonalization is a specific form of similarity transformation where the resulting matrix \\(B\\) is a diagonal matrix. When \\(A\\) is diagonalizable, it means that it can be transformed into a diagonal matrix through a similarity transformation. The matrix \\(P\\) in the diagonalization process consists of the eigenvectors of \\(A\\), and the diagonal matrix \\(D\\) contains the corresponding eigenvalues.

Diagonalization is a powerful technique as it allows us to express a matrix in a simpler form, making it easier to analyze and compute various matrix operations. It provides insights into the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a matrix, which are important for understanding its behavior and properties.

In Python, you can perform diagonalization and similarity transformations using the NumPy library. Here's an example code that demonstrates how to do it:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2],
              [3, 4]])

# Perform diagonalization
eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(A)
eigenvalues_diag = np.diag(eigenvalues)
V = eigenvectors
V_inv = np.linalg.inv(V)

# Compute similarity transformation
D = np.dot(np.dot(V_inv, A), V)

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Diagonal matrix D:\n", D)
print("Eigenvectors V:\n", V)
print("Eigenvalues (diagonal elements of D):\n", np.diag(D))
```

In this code, we define a matrix `A` using a NumPy array. We then use the `np.linalg.eig()` function to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrix `A`. The eigenvalues are stored in a NumPy array called `eigenvalues`, and the eigenvectors are stored in a NumPy array called `eigenvectors`.

We construct a diagonal matrix `eigenvalues_diag` using the eigenvalues, and the matrix `V` contains the eigenvectors as columns.

To perform diagonalization, we compute the inverse of `V` and use it to compute the similarity transformation `D = V_inv * A * V`. The resulting matrix `D` should be a diagonal matrix.

When you run this code, it will output the original matrix `A`, the diagonal matrix `D`, the matrix of eigenvectors `V`, and the eigenvalues as the diagonal elements of `D`. The output will look like:

```python
Matrix A:
 [[1 2]
 [3 4]]
Diagonal matrix D:
 [[-0.37228132  0.        ]
 [ 0.          5.37228132]]
Eigenvectors V:
 [[-0.82456484 -0.41597356]
 [ 0.56576746 -0.90937671]]
Eigenvalues (diagonal elements of D):
 [-0.37228132  5.37228132]
```

This demonstrates the diagonalization of matrix `A` and the resulting diagonal matrix `D`, where the eigenvalues are the diagonal elements. The eigenvectors are the columns of matrix `V`.

## Linear Systems

### Solving Linear Systems

Solving linear systems of equations is a common problem in mathematics and applied sciences. It involves finding the values of unknown variables that satisfy a set of linear equations. There are various methods to solve linear systems, including direct methods and iterative methods. Let's explore some of these methods:

**Direct Methods**: Direct methods aim to find the exact solution to the linear system in a finite number of steps. These methods include:

1. **Gaussian Elimination**: Gaussian elimination is a widely used method that transforms the system into an upper triangular form by applying elementary row operations. Back substitution is then used to find the values of the unknown variables.
    
2. **LU Decomposition**: LU decomposition factorizes the coefficient matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix (L) and an upper triangular matrix (U). This factorization allows for efficient solving of multiple linear systems with the same coefficient matrix.
    
3. **Cholesky Decomposition**: Cholesky decomposition is specifically used for symmetric positive definite matrices. It decomposes the matrix into the product of a lower triangular matrix and its conjugate transpose. This method is more efficient for symmetric matrices compared to Gaussian elimination.
    

**Iterative Methods**: Iterative methods approximate the solution to the linear system by iteratively refining an initial guess. These methods include:

1. **Jacobi Method**: The Jacobi method iteratively updates the values of the unknown variables using the previous iteration's values. It converges to the solution when certain conditions are met, such as matrix diagonal dominance.
    
2. **Gauss-Seidel Method**: The Gauss-Seidel method is similar to the Jacobi method but updates the variables in a different order. It typically converges faster than the Jacobi method for diagonally dominant matrices.
    
3. **Conjugate Gradient Method**: The conjugate gradient method is an iterative method specifically designed for solving symmetric positive definite systems. It iteratively minimizes the error by finding conjugate directions in the solution space.
    

**Numerical Libraries and Packages**: When implementing these methods in practice, it is common to use numerical libraries and packages that provide optimized and efficient routines for solving linear systems. Examples of such libraries include:

* **NumPy**: NumPy is a popular numerical computing library in Python that provides functions for solving linear systems, such as `numpy.linalg.solve` for direct methods and `numpy.linalg.lstsq` for least squares problems.
    
* **SciPy**: SciPy is a scientific computing library in Python that builds upon NumPy and provides additional functionalities, including advanced linear algebra routines for solving linear systems and matrix factorizations.
    
* **MATLAB**: MATLAB is a widely used numerical computing environment that offers built-in functions for solving linear systems, such as the backslash operator `\` or the `linsolve` function.
    

These libraries and packages abstract away the complexities of the underlying algorithms and provide efficient and reliable solutions for solving linear systems.

Overall, solving linear systems is a fundamental problem in mathematics and scientific computing. Direct methods offer exact solutions, while iterative methods provide approximate solutions with varying levels of accuracy and convergence speed. The choice of method depends on the properties of the system, the size of the problem, and the desired accuracy. Utilizing numerical libraries and packages can simplify the implementation and leverage optimized algorithms for efficient solutions.

Alright, so we won't get into the nitty-gritty of those iterative methods just yet.

### Gaussian Elimination

Gaussian elimination is a widely used method for solving linear systems of equations. It transforms the system into an equivalent system in row-echelon form, making it easier to find the values of the unknown variables. The basic steps of Gaussian elimination are as follows:

1. **Augmented Matrix**: Write the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix, which is a matrix that combines the coefficients of the variables and the constants on the right-hand side.
    
2. **Pivoting**: Choose a pivot element in the augmented matrix. The pivot element is typically the largest absolute value in the current column. If necessary, interchange rows to ensure that the pivot element is nonzero. This step helps avoid division by zero during subsequent steps.
    
3. **Elimination**: Perform row operations to eliminate the coefficients below the pivot element in the current column. This involves subtracting multiples of one row from another row to create zeros below the pivot element. Repeat this process for each row and column, working from left to right and from top to bottom.
    
4. **Row-Echelon Form**: Continue the elimination process until the augmented matrix is in row-echelon form. In row-echelon form, each pivot element is the only nonzero entry in its column, and all entries below the pivot element are zeros.
    
5. **Back Substitution**: Starting from the bottom row, solve for each unknown variable by substituting the known values from the rows above. Back substitution allows you to obtain the values of the unknown variables one by one.
    
6. **Solution**: Once back substitution is complete, you have the solution to the linear system. The unknown variables are determined, and you can substitute these values back into the original equations to verify the solution.
    

Here's an example of Gaussian elimination in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Coefficient matrix
A = np.array([[2, 1, -1],
              [-3, -1, 2],
              [-2, 1, 2]])

# Constant vector
b = np.array([8, -11, -3])

# Augmented matrix
augmented = np.column_stack((A, b))

# Gaussian elimination
rows, cols = augmented.shape

for i in range(rows):
    # Pivoting
    max_row = np.argmax(np.abs(augmented[i:, i])) + i
    augmented[[i, max_row]] = augmented[[max_row, i]]
    
    # Elimination
    for j in range(i + 1, rows):
        factor = augmented[j, i] / augmented[i, i]
        augmented[j, :] -= factor * augmented[i, :]
        
# Back substitution
x = np.zeros(cols - 1)
for i in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):
    x[i] = (augmented[i, -1] - np.dot(augmented[i, :-1], x)) / augmented[i, i]

print("Solution:")
print(x)
```

This code uses the NumPy library to perform the Gaussian elimination algorithm. The coefficient matrix `A` and constant vector `b` define the linear system. The code performs Gaussian elimination with pivoting, eliminates the coefficients, and performs back substitution to obtain the solution. Finally, it prints the solution to the linear system.

It's important to note that in practice, you should handle special cases such as when the matrix is singular or when the system has no solution. These cases can be detected during the elimination process by encountering zero pivot elements or inconsistent rows.

Given the following system of linear equations:

```python
 2x+y‚àíz=8¬†
‚àí3x‚àíy+2z=‚àí11¬†
‚àí2x+y+2z=‚àí3
```

We can write the augmented matrix representing the system as:

```python
[[2 1 ‚àí1 8
¬†‚àí3 ‚àí1 2 ‚àí11¬†
 ‚àí2 1 2 ‚àí3] 
]
```

Applying Gaussian elimination to the augmented matrix, we perform the following row operations:

1. Swap rows R1 and R2:
    
    ```python
    [[‚àí3 ‚àí1 2 ‚àí11
    ¬†2 1 ‚àí1 8¬†
     ‚àí2 1 2 ‚àí3] 
    ]
    ```
    
2. Multiply R1 by 2 and add it to R2, multiply R1 by -2 and add it to R3:
    
    ```python
     [[‚àí3 ‚àí1 2 ‚àí11
    ¬†0 1 3 5¬†
     0 1 2 ‚àí17] 
    ]
    ```
    
3. Multiply R2 by -1 and add it to R3:
    
    ```python
    [[‚àí3 ‚àí1 2 ‚àí11
    ¬†0 1 3 5¬†
     0 0 ‚àí1 ‚àí22] 
    ]
    ```
    

At this point, the augmented matrix is in row-echelon form. Now, we can perform back substitution to find the values of the unknown variables:

1. Solve the third equation for z: \\((-z = -22 \Rightarrow z = 22)\\)
    
2. Substitute the value of z into the second equation: \\((y + 3z = 5 \Rightarrow y + 3(22) = 5 \Rightarrow y = -61)\\)
    
3. Substitute the values of y and z into the first equation: \\((-3x - y + 2z = -11 \Rightarrow -3x - (-61) + 2(22) = -11 \Rightarrow x = 3)\\)
    

Therefore, the solution to the system of linear equations is \\((x = 3), (y = -61), \;\;and\;\; (z = 22).\\)

## Matrix Decompositions

### LU Decomposition

LU decomposition, also known as LU factorization, is a method in linear algebra to decompose a square matrix A into the product of two matrices, L and U. LU decomposition is commonly used to solve systems of linear equations, invert matrices, and perform other matrix operations efficiently. Let's explain LU decomposition in detail:

**LU Decomposition**: Given a square matrix A, the LU decomposition expresses it as the product of two matrices, L and U: A = LU

where L is a lower triangular matrix with ones on the diagonal, and U is an upper triangular matrix. The lower triangular matrix L contains all the coefficients below the main diagonal, while the upper triangular matrix U contains all the coefficients on and above the main diagonal of A.

**Algorithm**: The LU decomposition can be computed using various algorithms, such as Gaussian elimination or Crout's method. The most common algorithm is the Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting. Here are the general steps to perform LU decomposition:

1. Start with the original matrix A.
    
2. Set up the initial L and U matrices as identity matrices of the same size as A.
    
3. Apply row operations to eliminate the coefficients below the main diagonal in each column, using Gaussian elimination.
    
4. Update the elements of L and U as the matrix A undergoes the row operations.
    
5. Repeat the row operations until the matrix A is transformed into an upper triangular form (U matrix).
    
6. The resulting matrix L, with the additional condition of ones on its diagonal, represents the lower triangular matrix.
    
7. The transformed matrix A is the upper triangular matrix U.
    

Here's an example code that demonstrates LU decomposition using the [`scipy.linalg.lu`](http://scipy.linalg.lu)`()` function from the SciPy library:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.linalg import lu

# Define the matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])

# Perform LU decomposition
P, L, U = lu(A)

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Permutation matrix P:\n", P)
print("Lower triangular matrix L:\n", L)
print("Upper triangular matrix U:\n", U)
```

In this code, we import the necessary libraries, including `numpy` and [`scipy.linalg.lu`](http://scipy.linalg.lu) from SciPy. We define the matrix `A` using a NumPy array.

We then use the `lu()` function to perform LU decomposition of the matrix `A`. The function returns three matrices: the permutation matrix `P`, the lower triangular matrix `L`, and the upper triangular matrix `U`.

Finally, we print the original matrix `A`, the permutation matrix `P`, the lower triangular matrix `L`, and the upper triangular matrix `U`.

When you run this code, it will output the original matrix `A`, the permutation matrix `P`, the lower triangular matrix `L`, and the upper triangular matrix `U`. The output will look like:

```python
Matrix A:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
Permutation matrix P:
 [[0. 1. 0.]
 [0. 0. 1.]
 [1. 0. 0.]]
Lower triangular matrix L:
 [[1.         0.         0.        ]
 [0.14285714 1.         0.        ]
 [0.57142857 0.5        1.        ]]
Upper triangular matrix U:
 [[ 7.00000000e+00  8.00000000e+00  9.00000000e+00]
 [ 0.00000000e+00 -8.57142857e-01 -1.71428571e+00]
 [ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00  2.22044605e-16]]
```

This demonstrates the LU decomposition of the matrix `A` using the [`scipy.linalg.lu`](http://scipy.linalg.lu)`()` function.

**Applications**: LU decomposition has several applications in numerical computations, such as:

1. Solving Systems of Linear Equations: Once A is decomposed into LU, solving systems of linear equations Ax = b becomes more computationally efficient. By substituting A = LU, the system can be solved in two steps: Ly = b (forward substitution) and Ux = y (back substitution).
    
2. Matrix Inversion: LU decomposition can be used to efficiently compute the inverse of a matrix. Once A is decomposed into LU, the inverse of A can be computed by solving a series of linear equations.
    
3. Determinant Calculation: The determinant of a matrix can be calculated using the LU decomposition. The determinant is the product of the diagonal elements of the U matrix, multiplied by the appropriate sign changes based on row interchanges during the decomposition process.
    
4. Matrix Factorization: LU decomposition provides a factorization of the original matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices. This factorization can be useful in various numerical algorithms, such as eigenvalue calculations, matrix exponentiation, and matrix powers.
    

Overall, LU decomposition is a powerful technique that allows us to efficiently solve systems of linear equations, compute matrix inverses, and perform other matrix operations by decomposing the original matrix into lower and upper triangular matrices.

### QR Decomposition

QR decomposition, also known as QR factorization, is a method in linear algebra to decompose a matrix A into the product of two matrices, Q and R. QR decomposition is commonly used for solving least squares problems, orthogonalizing a set of vectors, and performing other matrix operations. Let's explain QR decomposition in detail:

**QR Decomposition**: Given an m√ón matrix A, where m ‚â• n, the QR decomposition expresses it as the product of two matrices, Q and R: A = QR

where Q is an m√óm orthogonal matrix, and R is an m√ón upper triangular matrix. The orthogonal matrix Q has the property Q^T \* Q = I, where Q^T is the transpose of Q and I is the identity matrix.

**Algorithm**: The QR decomposition can be computed using various algorithms, such as Gram-Schmidt process, Householder transformation, or Givens rotation. The most commonly used algorithms for practical purposes are Householder transformation and Givens rotation.

1. Householder Transformation: This algorithm uses Householder reflectors to orthogonalize the columns of the matrix A. It iteratively transforms A into an upper triangular matrix R while accumulating the transformations in Q.
    
2. Givens Rotation: This algorithm uses Givens rotations to zero out the elements below the main diagonal of A, gradually transforming A into an upper triangular matrix R. The orthogonal matrix Q is obtained by accumulating the Givens rotations.
    

Both algorithms compute the matrices Q and R in a way that preserves the product A = QR.

Sure! Here's an example code that demonstrates QR decomposition using the `numpy.linalg.qr()` function in Python:

```python
import numpy as np

# Define the matrix
A = np.array([[1, 2, 3],
              [4, 5, 6],
              [7, 8, 9]])

# Perform QR decomposition
Q, R = np.linalg.qr(A)

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Orthogonal matrix Q:\n", Q)
print("Upper triangular matrix R:\n", R)
```

In this code, we import the `numpy` library and define the matrix `A` using a NumPy array.

We then use the `numpy.linalg.qr()` function to perform QR decomposition of the matrix `A`. The function returns two matrices: the orthogonal matrix `Q` and the upper triangular matrix `R`.

Finally, we print the original matrix `A`, the orthogonal matrix `Q`, and the upper triangular matrix `R`.

When you run this code, it will output the original matrix `A`, the orthogonal matrix `Q`, and the upper triangular matrix `R`. The output will look like:

```python
Matrix A:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
Orthogonal matrix Q:
 [[-0.12309149 -0.90453403  0.40824829]
 [-0.49236596 -0.30151134 -0.81649658]
 [-0.86164044  0.30151134  0.40824829]]
Upper triangular matrix R:
 [[-8.12403840e+00 -9.60113630e+00 -1.10782359e+01]
 [ 0.00000000e+00  9.60113630e-01  1.92022726e+00]
 [ 0.00000000e+00  0.00000000e+00 -1.48029737e-15]]
```

This demonstrates the QR decomposition of the matrix `A` using the `numpy.linalg.qr()` function in Python.

**Applications**: QR decomposition has several applications in numerical computations, such as:

1. Solving Least Squares Problems: QR decomposition is commonly used to solve overdetermined systems of linear equations, also known as least squares problems. By decomposing the matrix A into QR, the least squares solution can be found efficiently.
    
2. Orthogonalization: QR decomposition is used to orthogonalize a set of vectors. The matrix Q obtained from the decomposition contains orthonormal vectors that span the same subspace as the original vectors. This property is useful in various applications, such as signal processing, data compression, and solving eigenvalue problems.
    
3. Eigenvalue Calculation: QR iteration, a method for computing eigenvalues of a matrix, utilizes QR decomposition. By iteratively decomposing the matrix and accumulating the transformations, the eigenvalues of a matrix can be approximated efficiently.
    
4. Conditioning and Stability: QR decomposition can provide insights into the conditioning and stability of a matrix. The properties of the matrices Q and R can be analyzed to understand the sensitivity of a problem and determine the numerical stability of computations.

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) is a fundamental matrix factorization technique in linear algebra. It decomposes a matrix into three separate matrices, representing the singular values, left singular vectors, and right singular vectors. SVD has a wide range of applications in various fields, including data analysis, image processing, recommender systems, and dimensionality reduction. Let's delve into SVD in more detail:

2. Diagonal Matrix: The matrix Œ£ is diagonal, with the singular values of A appearing on the diagonal. The singular values are non-negative real numbers and represent the importance or magnitude of each singular vector.
    
3. Rank and Dimensionality Reduction: The rank of the matrix A is equal to the number of non-zero singular values in Œ£. If some singular values are close to zero, they can be discarded, resulting in a lower-rank approximation of A. This property enables dimensionality reduction and noise reduction in data analysis.
    
4. Reconstruction: The original matrix A can be reconstructed by multiplying the three matrices: A = UŒ£V^T. By selecting a subset of singular values and corresponding singular vectors, we can obtain an approximation of A.

U, S, V = np.linalg.svd(A)

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Left singular matrix U:\n", U)
print("Singular values S:", S)
print("Right singular matrix V:\n", V)
```

**Cholesky Decomposition**: Given a symmetric positive definite matrix A, Cholesky decomposition expresses it as the product of a lower triangular matrix L and its conjugate transpose: A = LL^H

where L is a lower triangular matrix, and L^H denotes the conjugate transpose of L.

**Properties of Cholesky Decomposition**: Cholesky decomposition possesses several important properties:

1. Positive Definiteness: The original matrix A must be symmetric positive definite for Cholesky decomposition to be applicable. Positive definiteness ensures that all eigenvalues of A are positive, and the decomposition yields a valid lower triangular matrix.
    
2. Efficiency: Cholesky decomposition is computationally efficient compared to other matrix factorization methods. Since the matrix A is symmetric, the decomposition only requires half the computations compared to general matrix factorizations.

# Define the matrix
A = np.array([[4, 12, -16],
              [12, 37, -43],
              [-16, -43, 98]])

# Perform Cholesky decomposition
L = np.linalg.cholesky(A)

print("Matrix A:\n", A)
print("Cholesky matrix L:\n", L)

Finally, we print the original matrix `A` and the Cholesky matrix `L`.

When you run this code, it will output the original matrix `A` and the Cholesky matrix `L`. The output will look like:

```python
Matrix A:
 [[  4  12 -16]
 [ 12  37 -43]
 [-16 -43  98]]
Cholesky matrix L:
 [[  2.           0.           0.        ]
 [  6.           1.           0.        ]
 [ -8.          -5.           3.        ]]
```

**Computing Cholesky Decomposition**: Cholesky decomposition can be computed using specialized algorithms, such as the Cholesky-Banachiewicz algorithm or the Cholesky-Crout algorithm. These algorithms exploit the structure of the matrix A and the properties of the Cholesky decomposition to efficiently compute the lower triangular matrix L.
